# Another intro to express
  A small crash course with express to keep my skills up to date. We will be using 
  express and handlesbar and nodemon in this small project
 
 ## Getting started
1. use `npm init ` to initialize an npm package where your  installed packages will live
2. use `npm install express` to install express for simple routing
3. use `npm install hbs` to install handlebars
4. use `npm install nodemon --save-Dev` to install nodemon to watch our project
